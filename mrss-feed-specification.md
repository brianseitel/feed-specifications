# MRSS Feed Specification

MRSS Feeds for Direct Publisher follows the [MRSS 1.5.1 specification](http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss), and [RSS 2.0 specification](http://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification), with a few modifications on which elements are required or optional. These changes focus on ensuring customers have all the information necessary for the best experience with your channel and the Roku platform.

This document has detailed information on the MRSS elements you can use to build out a Direct Publisher-compatible MRSS feed, as well as examples to help along the way. We only parse the elements described in this document, and any other provided will be ignored.

In the example Roku Channel image below, you can see where the fields of your MRSS feed will be used:
